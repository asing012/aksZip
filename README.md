# aksZip
Crack zip file 

Requirements:
(1) Make sure you have python2 installed in your system.

How to run:
(1) You can run the program by typing "python aksZip.py" in the command line or you can also give the file chmod u+x permission and it will allow you to run it just by typing ./aksZip.py

(2) Once you run the program it will ask you two things:
  (a) Enter the name of the zip file to crack (evil.zip)
  (b) Enter the name of the dictionary file to use (dictionary.txt)
  
(3) It will print "password found" when it finds the password and it will also extract the zip file in the same directory.

(4) Try using a dictionary file that has different words if you don't see "password found".
